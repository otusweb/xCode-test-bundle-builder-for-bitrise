        (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.
        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!
